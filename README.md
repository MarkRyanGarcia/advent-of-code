# 🎄 Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my repository of **Advent of Code** solutions! 🎁  

## 📅 What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an advent calendar for programmers. Every day from December 1st to December 25th, a new two-part programming puzzle is released. Each puzzle is designed to be solvable in any programming language and at varying levels of difficulty.

### 🔧 Run Script

The runall.sh script automates the process of executing all solution scripts for a specified year in the repository. If no year is provided, the script defaults to the current year.
Use `./runall.sh` to run.

### 📂 Structure
